Last wednesday, the first regular openEO PSC meeting took place.
We have now agreed to meeting on a monthly basis, each **first Wednesday of the month at 15:00 CET/CEST**.
We will always discuss the open issues in the [PSC issue tracker](https://github.com/Open-EO/PSC/issues) and talk through the future and strategic directions openEO is heading towards.
The meetings are open to the public and anyone can join as a guest. 
If you'd like to join the next meeting, please contact `openeo.psc@uni-muenster.de` and we'll send you an invite.
