# openEO community meetings

The openEO PSC hosts monthly community meetings where the openEO community comes together for discussions.

This is meant to be a *project-independant* platform for developers to announce news,
inform about recent or planned work, exchange ideas, discuss issues and get to
know each other. Everyone is welcome!

We start with specific topics (see table below), often in the form of a presentation or moderated discussion
and haven an open forum for discussions, questions and other topics afterwards.

- **Date:** every first Wednesday of a month at 14:00 CET/CEST
- **Meeting venue:** [Zoom](https://wwu.zoom.us/j/66698432546?pwd=YVVhbGFLY3RBaWlMcGhza3lPSWQ2dz09)

*Note: There's currently a poll running for changing the date and time of the meeting, so dates and times may change starting from September.*

If you'd like to get an invite for your calender, please send an e-mail to [openeo.psc@uni-muenster.de](mailto:openeo.psc@uni-muenster.de).
