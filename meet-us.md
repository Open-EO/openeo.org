# Meet us

We are always happy to present and discuss the current state of the project. You can **meet us at the following events**:

* ESA PhiWeek (October 11-15, openEO Platform public launch event, including keynote and workshop)

Due to the COVID-19 situation there are no in-person meetings planned. We'll post further information here once available.
