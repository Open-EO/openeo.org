# User-defined functions

The abbreviation **UDF** stands for **user-defined function**. With the simple [run_udf() process call](https://processes.openeo.org/#run_udf), users are able to upload custom code and have it executed e.g. for every pixel of a scene, allowing custom calculations on server-side data.

UDFs are currently developed and evaluated outside of the core API. More information regarding the current **draft** for UDFs can be found in a [separate repository](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-udf). There is additional documentation available for the [UDF Framework](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-udf/) and the [UDF API](https://open-eo.github.io/openeo-udf/api_docs/).
