The openEO PSC is pleased to announce a new monthly openEO community meeting that
takes place **every first Wednesday of a month at 14:00 CET**.

This is meant to be a *project-independant* platform for developers to announce news,
inform about recent or planned work, exchange ideas, discuss issues and get to
know each other. In the past there have been project-specific developer calls, but
we would like to build bridges between projects and coordinate the work better.

**If you'd like to join these calls, please send an e-mail to [openeo.psc@uni-muenster.de](mailto:openeo.psc@uni-muenster.de).**
Everyone is welcome!
