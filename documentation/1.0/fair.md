# Support for FAIR principles in openEO backends

[FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) provide some guidelines when producing and sharing datasets.

An openEO backend can make it easier to comply with these principles, by incorporating these principles in the implementation, so that
users are automatically a step closer to generating FAIR-compliant open data. 

These are a few examples that you want to look for as a user, or that a backend provider may want to implement:

- *[F2 Rich metadata](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/f2-data-described-rich-metadata/)* openEO backends generate STAC metadata, 
  backends are encouraged to make it rich by including processing info, complete raster metadata, band information, etcetera.
- *[R1.2 Detailed provenance](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-2-metadata-associated-detailed-provenance/)* In result metadata [derived-from](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/item-spec/item-spec.md#derived_from)
  links can link back to all input products to provide provenance.
- *[R1.3 use of domain relevant metadata standard](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-3-metadata-meet-domain-relevant-community-standards/)* openEO generates STAC metadata, so this one is included by default.

As openEO backends do not automatically publish the data you generate, there's also a number of principles that still require some attention, 
but still, with data and metadata generated by openEO, you should get a headstart!
