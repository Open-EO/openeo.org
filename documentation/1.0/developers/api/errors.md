The general error handling in the openEO API is documented in the [API documentation](reference.md#section/API-Principles/Error-Handling).

The following table of error codes is **incomplete**. These error codes will evolve over time. If you are missing any common error, please contribute it by adding an [issue](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-api/issues/new), creating a [pull request](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-api/pulls) or get in [contact](/contact.md).
