# Introduction

First of all, a good idea is to get familiar with the terminology in openEO by reading the [glossary](./glossary.md).
There's also an in-depth [introduction to datacubes](./datacubes.md) and processing them with openEO.

Currently, there are three official client libraries, a web-based interface for openEO and a QGIS plugin.

If you are **unfamiliar** with programming, you could start using the [web-based editor for openEO](https://editor.openeo.org). It supports visual modelling of your algorithms and a simplified JavaScript based access to the openEO workflows and providers. openEO can also be used in QGIS through a [QGIS plugin](./qgis/index.md).

If you are **familiar** with programming, you could choose a client library for three programming languages:

* [JavaScript](./javascript/index.md) (client-side and server-side)
* [Python](./python/index.md)
* [R](./r/index.md)

Follow the links above to find usage instructions for each of the client libraries.

For details about available processes, see the **[list of openEO processes](processes.md)**. The **[openEO Cookbook](cookbook/index.md)** describes common use-cases with code examples in all three languages.

The more advanced topic to run your own code on back-ends, is explained in the introduction to [openEO UDFs (user-defined functions)](udfs.md).

::: Note
This is the documentation for the **openEO API version 1.0**. If you are looking for other versions of openEO, please use the version switch at the top right of this page.
