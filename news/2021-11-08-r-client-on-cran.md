Today, we released a new version 1.1.0 of the openEO R Client, which features a couple of [improvements and bug fixes](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-r-client/blob/master/NEWS.md#version-110).

At the same time, the R client has been published on CRAN, too: [openeo](https://cran.r-project.org/package=openeo)
This means you can now install the R client more easily and directly through CRAN with the following command:

```r
install.packages("openeo")
```

If you have trouble installing or working with the package, feel free to leave an issue in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-r-client/issues).
